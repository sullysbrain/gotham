# Project Gotham: A Home Netowrk PySpark Cluster

Project Gotham is my home network's PySpark cluster for my machine learning and neural network projects. I will post here for others to learn from my mistakes. :D

Why the name 'Gotham'? As a Batman fan, setting up a Spark cluster in my mind is similar to the grid in the city of Gotham. I picture each section of Gotham as its own cluster, joined together like the electrical grid in the city, all connected and working together.
